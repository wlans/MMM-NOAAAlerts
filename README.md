# MMM-NOAAAlerts

Magic Mirror module to display current local weather warnings and alerts.

I built this module more by need than anything else â€” the Seattle area where I live had been hit by some relatively severe weather, causing real problems for the region. While I wasn't caught off-guard by this storm, I realized that the MM weather modules I had didn't emphasize local warnings, alerts, and weather watches. So I built a module expressly for solving that problem.

**MMM-NOAAAlerts**

## USING THE MODULE

### Standard installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmtsweng/MMM-NOAAAlerts
cd MMM-NOAAAlerts
npm install 
```

### Basic configuration

Below is an example configuration. Note that the new `marqueeDelay` option (defaulting to 2000 ms) is used when `showAsMarquee` is enabled. When marquee mode is enabled, the module will scroll the entire text smoothly, pause for the specified delay, and then advance to the next alert.

```js
{
  module: "MMM-NOAAAlerts",
  position: "top_bar",
  config: {
      userAgent: "Magic Mirror (xxxxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com)", // Custom contact information
      APIURL: "https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?point=47.593,-122.333", // See below for other options
      debug: false, // [Optional] Print extended debugging logs to the console
      rotateInterval: 15 * 1000, // [Optional] How often to rotate to the next alert in non-marquee mode
      updateInterval: 30 * 60 * 1000, // [Optional] How often to ping the API for updated data
      showDescription: true,  // [Optional] Show detailed description of the alert
      showInstruction: false, // [Optional] Show instructions provided by NOAA
      showNoAlertText: false, // [Optional] Display noAlertText when there are no active alerts
      noAlertText: 'There are no active weather alerts in this area', // [Optional] Text to display if no alerts are available
      showAsMarquee: true,  // [Optional] When true, text scrolls from left-to-right
      marqueeDelay: 2000    // [Optional] Delay (in ms) after a full marquee scroll before advancing (default: 2000 ms)
  }
},
```

## NOAA API Information

NOAA provides a [free API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) to retrieve weather alerts, which this module uses. No registration is required.

There are multiple ways to set the forecast area. NOAA offers extensive documentation [here](https://www.weather.gov/media/documentation/docs/NWS_Geolocation.pdf) if you need additional help. Below are some of the basic methods:

| **Option** | **URL** |
| --- | --- |
| By State | `https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?area={state}` |
| By [Zone](https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/wa.php?x=2) | `https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?zone={zone}` |
| By Lat/Long | `https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude},{longitude}` |
| By Grid | `https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/{office}/{grid X},{grid Y}/forecast` |

**Important:** NOAA requires that a User-Agent header be provided. Please set your own custom agent in the configuration with unique contact information. The suggested header format is:  
`User-Agent: (myweatherapp.com, contact@myweatherapp.com)`

## Updated Marquee Scrolling Behavior

When `showAsMarquee` is enabled:
- The module calculates the full scroll distance required for the alert text.
- It smoothly scrolls the text from left-to-right.
- After the entire text is displayed (i.e., fully scrolled), the module pauses for the duration set by the `marqueeDelay` option (default: 2000 ms) before advancing to the next alert.
- In non-marquee mode, the module will wait for the `rotateInterval` (default: 15 seconds) before advancing.

This ensures that the full text is visible before moving on to the next alert, providing a better user experience.
